## Creating a Model from scratch

# Use case:
    Problem : We can use this qudratic equation in the find the price of house based on it's square foot.
 	Context: A linear model (y=mc+b) might not capture the relationship between square footage and price accurately, especially when small houses are disproportionately less expensive, and very large houses have premium pricing.
	Use of Quadratic Model : The quadratic model allows for a curve that can show how price increases at a different rate as square footage grows, fitting the reality that larger houses may see exponential price growth.
 
# Problem Statement:
    Fit a 2 degree ploynomial onto the given X and true Y, which is coming from the equation Y = -2 X^2 -X + 2  
 
# Approach:
